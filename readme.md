### Loops

## Assignment
1. You need to [refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) your first assignment to use variables, functions and loops. People who missed the first class are expected to be caught up by the time this assignment is due.
To do this you just need to add more commits to your pull request and hit "sync" in GitHub Desktop.

2. You need to make another program (like the first week) that uses a loop within a loop to create a grid of objects. Bonus points if it's something generated by a function you defined. You pull put in a pull request into [this repo (assignment2)](https://github.com/ArtG2260SpringTuesday2016/Assignment1). I will be updating that repo with class notes resources and a reading should be helpful with your assignment.

3. Create a program that takes in a number and then prints (console.log()) out all numbers from 0 to that number but on numbers that are divisible by 3 it prints out "flap", numbers that are divisible by 5 it prints out "jacks", on numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 it prints out "flapjacks"

The program should be named "flapperJacks" and will be called like this:

```javascript
flapperJacks(32) //32 can be any number.
```

I will be creating individual shared private repos for this assignment. Message me if you do not appear on [this page](https://github.com/orgs/ArtG2260SpringTuesday2016/people) message me.

4. Fill out [this survey](https://surveyplanet.com/56a06616823af13b2fdf727f)…or don't I won't know, you have the option of being anonymous. It does help me figure out what we're doing over the next week.

Remember, I respond a lot faster on Slack or through GitHub. I also encourage you to ask questions to each other in the appropriate slack channel.
